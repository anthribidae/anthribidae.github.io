# About Anthribidae of the World

This is a website dedicated to the family Anthribidae (Coleoptera: Curculionoidea). The aim is to display the diversity of this group across the world, featuring the species available at the O'Brien Collection [(ASUCOB)](https://serv.biokic.asu.edu/ecdysis/collections/misc/collprofiles.php?collid=2), now part of the Biocollections at the [Biodiversity Knowledge Integration Center](https://biokic.asu.edu/), in Arizona State University. 

The site is developed by Samanta Orellana, current PhD Student in Evolutionary Biology at Arizona State University focused on the Systematics and Diversity of Anthribidae.
